The goal of this project is to allow visualizations of large
networks in the browser. 

We implement query processing on the gpu, to allow users to interact
with graphs far larger than before. This allows to see structure and 
substructure of the graph in realtime, for hundreds of thousands of edges.

Previous javascript based graph visualization libraries do not support this,
and are not dynamic at scale.

By computing dynamic position and layout on the cpu, you must
choose between realtime response times, and 

This system is designed specifically for longitudinal networks, and sparse
matrices. Both of these data structures do not play well with conventional 
analytics techniques. Visualization can help analysts understand these data
structures better.

To answer your questions, at Periscope I've seen:
1. A line graph of amplitude over time. You should see the frequency emerge clear as day. If you want to calculate frequency explicitly, you could overlay a second line with its own axis. Again, super simple, but gives you the answer directly.
2. I've seen a lot of fancy graph visuali
zations, but nothing that makes me happy. Depending on what you want to know about your graph, maybe a simple table with a structure like:
  [node name][node name][weight]
Or:
  [timestamp][node name][node name][weight]
A pivot table on top of this data, transoforming the second node column into the table's horizontal axis, can also be useful.
3. OK, obviously I think Periscope is a great choice here. Loads of data analysts use it to visualize time series data on many tens/hundreds of billions of data points.
That said, other good choices are: Excel, R/Stata/Matlab, gnuplot, Apache Pig. And for the data storage itself, IMO Amazon Redshift is unparalleled.
